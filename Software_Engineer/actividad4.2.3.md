Game idea
Manticore is a strategic card-based adventure game where the player is a protagonist who, along with the rest of the villagers, have been hypnotized by a magician passing through the town with a circus. The player must navigate the distorted townscape to find the magician responsible for their altered perceptions and be returned back to normal.

The game combines exploration of a pixel art map with engaging card battles, unfolding the story through the card matches and some cutscenes.







Gameplay
The game integrates exploration with card-based combat. Each level on the 2D pixel art map represents a card battle that progressively reveals the storyline through both victories and defeats. Players encounter a variety of enemies transformed by the protagonist's distorted perception into fantastical beings. The primary objective is to reach the magician, overcoming obstacles such as complex cards and deceptive environments that tweak gameplay mechanics. Success in battles depends on strategic deck management and the ability to adapt tactics to the shifting conditions influenced by the magician effects.
Mindset
The game is designed to induce a sense of curiosity, encouraging players to continuously question the reality presented within the game. Exploration is meant to be adventurous, with card combat phases designed to be intense and strategic, creating an intellectually engaging atmosphere. This employs a unique blend of eerie, whimsical music and unsettling yet compelling cutscenes, utilizing images and dialogue boxes to enhance the narrative. This artistic approach supports the theme of fluctuating reality, aiming to disorient yet captivate players, making each session a uniquely challenging and immersive experience.
