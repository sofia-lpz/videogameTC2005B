/*
cardAnimationManager.cs

This script is responsible for managing the animations of the cards in the trading card game. 
It includes a public float variable for the duration of the card animation. 
When the game object this script is attached to is instantiated, it starts a coroutine that waits for the duration of the card animation and then destroys the game object. 
This is used to play a one-time animation such as a card being played or discarded, and then remove the animation from the game.
