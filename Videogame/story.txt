PICA HAS ALWAYS HAD PICA. the hypochondric man is ill cause he has pica

BUT WHO?
a horse racer
bald librarian
actually just a lamp post you thought was a robot?

a boy training for war who perhaps shouldnt
a minsiter passing by to check on the town

a prince come from faraway
THAT TIGER... YOU SEE THE TIGER? BEHIND ME?
a fish

card reader
school teacher with aarmy
player of clavichord

Aureliano 


BUT WHAT?

escapism
denial
intellectualization
repression
avoidance
idealization
fantasy
nihilism
aloofness
nostalgia

it will stay ñike this forever

 the less one remembers, the better equipped they are to survive in the world after the collapse

she becomes increasingly fixated on the spiritual meaning of the pandemic






3, 2, 1... 
and a million times more Adria... 
3, 2, 1...

Adrias eyes flutter open, awake suddenly at nothing in particular
Don't magicians snap their fingers to wake people up?

ah!
now adira tell me
do you feel hypnotized


Adria doesn't know how to answer.
He feels the clammy hand of the magician on his shoulder.
He feels the heat of the spotlight of the small theatre.
Not much more.

Not really, says Adria

ah!
youll see!!




the fridge is empty. The market hasnt passed through since colometa
the window. You havent seen a lot of people out since colometa
a ticket to a show. it is colometa's show

everything looks...
sort of strange... a bit brighter
maybe spring is early
its a welcome change

Adria tries rbeifly to remember
when he went on the stage...
when colometa started talking...
he just remembers waking up, feeling exactly the same

imagine yourself in a safe place, adria.

Adria pretends he imagined her mothers hosue
shes not sure whwere she imagined herself


Dont you wish for an adventure Adria?
