Your eyes flutter open, awake suddenly at nothing in particular
¿Don't magicians snap their fingers to wake us up?

3... 2... 1... and now Adria tell the audience... do you feel hypnotized?

He feels the clammy hand of the magician on his shoulder.
He feels the heat of the spotlight of the small theatre.
Not much more.

Not really, says Adria

Ah... Are you sure about that?
