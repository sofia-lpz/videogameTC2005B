### **Summary**

"Chasing Colometa" is a strategic card-based RPG set in a lonely village. The player must navigate the village to uncover the mystery behind a magic show gone awry. Throughout the journey, the player encounters various memories and interacts with villagers affected by the incident. The game combines exploration of a pixel art map with card battles.

### **Gameplay**

The game integrates exploration with card-based combat. The storyline unfolds through the map and card matches. Players encounter enemies transformed by the protagonist's distorted perception into fantastical beings. The primary objective is to find a lost girl and uncover what happened to her.

Success in battle depends on strategic deck management and the ability to adapt tactics to changing conditions.

### **Mindset**

The game is designed to induce a sense of curiosity, encouraging players to question the reality presented within the game. Exploration is meant to be adventurous, while the card combat phase is intense and strategic, creating an intellectually engaging atmosphere. The game employs eerie, whimsical music and unsettling yet compelling cutscenes, using dialogue boxes to enhance the narrative. This artistic approach supports the theme of fluctuating reality, aiming to disorient yet captivate players, making each session a uniquely challenging and immersive experience.

### **Mechanics**

The player will navigate a 2D pixel art map of the town from a top-down angle using their arrow keys. They will find objects on the map to interact with, activating cutscenes and revealing more of the story. Characters encountered on the map will further the story through interactions.

**TCG Mechanics**

When the player encounters a character, a 1v1 card match begins. There are two types of cards: character cards and action cards.

1. Reason beats Terror
2. Terror beats Dream
3. Dream beats Reason

There are 3 elements that the characters cards will have, Terror, Dream, and Reason. If the element is countered, the winning element will make more damage and receive less damage. The elements synergy is the following:
1. Terror beats Dream
2. Dream beats Reason
3. Reason beats Terror

</p>

After selecting the 2 character cards, there will be a coin toss to decide which player starts their turn first, after this both players will have the energy that they will have that turn randomized, the energy will be used to use action cards, this will have an energy cost, the player can play all the cards they want, it is limited by the energy. The active character will be the first character that they choose. The player can choose the active character when it is their turn but it will have energy cost of 1 to switch active characters and will  only be able to do it once per turn.

</p>

Each character card will have a role, depending on their element, the roles will be: dps, tank, support. This goes like this:
1. DPS characters will be the element Terror characters that will have 2 initial attack points but no initial defense points.
2. Tank character will be the element Dream characters that will have 3 initial defense points but no initial attack points.
3. Support character will be the element Reason characters that will have 1 initial attack point and 1 initial defense point.

</p>

The action cards will help to do the actions the character will do, within the action cards there are many actions that can be made, there are cards to attack the active character card of the opponent, other to heal your current active character, other to increase the attack points of the active character, other to decrease the attack points of the active enemy character, other to decrease the defense points of the active enemy character, other to apply defense to your current active character, and other to skip the enemy turn.

</p>

 If the player has not enough energy points to use a card or doesn't want to use his energy points, he can end his turn. Every turn, both players will draw 3 cards from their deck, the cards will be random, also each round the energy points will be restarted and randomized once again. When a player is defeated, automatically it will change to the other character if this has not been defeated. The player that first defeats the 2 character cards of the other player, will win.
